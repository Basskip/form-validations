# Form Validations

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/forms-javascript) curriculum, implementing some JavaScript validations on a form

Solution heavily based on examples from [these MDN examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)

## Things I learned
* How to use validation attributes on form elements
* How to use the Constraint Validation API

## Things to work on
* Checking whether the error fields are empty to decide whether the form should submit feels VERY hacky

# Check it out yourself
